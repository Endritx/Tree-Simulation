# 3D Tree Growth Simulation with Rain Effect

This project showcases a simple 3D tree growth simulation using Three.js, combined with a rain effect and rain sound. The tree grows and shrinks dynamically while the rain falls and triggers a sound. The rain and sound can be controlled with a "Start to Rain" button.

## Features

- **3D Tree Representation**: A simple tree with a trunk and foliage is rendered using Three.js.
- **Dynamic Tree Growth**: The tree grows and shrinks based on the proximity of raindrops.
- **Rain Effect**: Simulated rain with falling raindrops rendered as particles.
- **Rain Sound**: A background sound of rain that loops when activated.
- **Start Rain Control**: Button to start the rain and the sound.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A 3D JavaScript library to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the page and button creation.
- **JavaScript**: For animating the rain and tree growth.
- **CSS**: For styling the buttons and positioning them on the screen.
